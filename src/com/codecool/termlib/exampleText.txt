I am an ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep
No set of rules could salvage me
Only a shipwreck, only a ghost
Merely a graveyard of your former self
We just watched the waves crash over
I've been cast astray

There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
(No one needs to know)
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
(No one needs to know)
